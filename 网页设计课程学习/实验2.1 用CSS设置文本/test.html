<h3>狐狸和葡萄</h3>
<p>饥饿的狐狸看见葡萄架上挂着一串串晶莹剔透的葡萄，口水直流，想要摘下来吃，但又摘不到。看了一会儿，无可奈何地走了，他边走边自己安慰自己说：“这葡萄没有熟，肯定是酸的。”这就是说，有些人能力小，做不成事，就借口说时机未成熟。</p>
<p>The hungry fox saw the vine hanging from a string of sparkling grape, mouth water, you want to eat off, but will not find any. Looked for a moment, helplessly away, he walked himself to comfort himself said: "This grape is not done, must be sour." This means that some capacity is small, do not accomplish anything, on the pretext that prematurely. </p>

<h3>狼与鹭鸶</h3>
<p>狼误吞下了一块骨头，十分难受，四处奔走，寻访医生。他遇见了鹭鸶，谈定酬金请他取出骨头，鹭鸶把自己的头伸进狼的喉咙里，叼出了骨头，便向狼要定好的酬金。狼回答说：“喂，朋友，你能从狼嘴里平安无事地收回头来，难道还不满足，怎么还要讲报酬？”这故事说明，对坏人行善的报酬，就是认识坏人不讲信用的本质。</p>
<p>Wolf who had a bone, it hurts, there and everywhere, searching for a doctor. He met the egret, negotiated payment had extracted the bone, egrets and his own head into the wolf's throat, took out the jaws of the wolf to be a good remuneration. Wolf replied: "Hey, friend, if you would recover without incident mouth and head, are not met, but also about how the money?" This story illustrates, on the bad guys do good reward, and bad people do not speak the nature of the credit. </p>
